blood and bones (5/8)|
|
as mentioned you can obtain these from cards killed either by yourself as a sacrifice or by your opponent's attack.
blood gets set back to zero once a round ends but bones persist. The main sources for blood are sacrificed hamsters, but you
can sacrifice any card if you so desire.|If you want to sacrifice more cards than free places are available you can do it in multiple stages, i.e.
first sacrifice the cards you want to sacrifice, then place the new ones and then sacrifice those. blood and bones will add up until
you end the round or invest them in placing some other card.
