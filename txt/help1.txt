the screen (2/8)|
|
the central element of the screen is the board on which the game takes place.
Each player has 4 columns to place their cards.
You have one row, the computer player has two rows to place cards on.
Note that this isn't a game of equal rules for you and the computer!
The computer has some advantages over you while you have others over him.|
Below the board, there's your status view. Here, you can see the amount of
bones and blood that you have (more on that later) as well as the point distribution.|
your points are being represented by the green bar and the computer's points by the red one.
