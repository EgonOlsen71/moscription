moscription is a deck-building card game for one player.
the goal is to deal direct damage to your opponent, the computer player.
a player wins once he or she has dealt 8 points more damage to the opponent than the opponent has to him/her.
The damage balance is shown by a red/green bar in the lower part of the screen.|
each card has an attack value ranging from 0 to x. direct damage is dealt only if there is
no opposing card on the board in the direction of the attack or if the defense value of the opposing
card is lower than the value of the attack (overkill). otherwise, the damage is dealt to the attacked card
instead, potentially damaging or killing it.
