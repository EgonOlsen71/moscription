place your card (4/8)|
|
move the icon with the displayed keys to place the card on a free spot. Each card costs an amount of either bones
or blood to be placed. if not enough bones/blood are available to you, you can't place the
card and have to move it down back into your hand.|
You obtain bones and blood by either losing cards to your opponent, which only gives you bones, or by sacrificing them yourself, which gives you both. That's the main
purpose of the hamsters. To sacrifice a card, simply press the number shown on top of it. You can always undo this unless you have
placed your card, in which case your sacrifice will be permanent in this game. The sacrificed cards return to your deck after the game
ends though.
