If the computer wins, all the player's card get returned to the deck and a new game starts on the same skill level.|
If the player wins, he can choose one of two cards to add to his deck. These cards are either cards that the computer was
actively playing on the board when the game ended, or (if there aren't enough computer player cards on the board) random ones.
After choosing a card, the game starts again on a higher skill level.
