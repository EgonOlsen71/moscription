# Moscription

Moscription is a deck building card game for the Commodore 64. It's an asymmetrical player vs. computer game.

Instructions on how to play can be found in-game by pressing the "h" key at (almost) any time.

If you can understand spoken german, there's a video available as well that explains the basics of the game: https://youtu.be/HQf1B-NZwbc

The repository contains all game assets and source code. If you are interested only in the playable, pre-built version, download the d64 image from here: https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/moscription/blob/main/build/moscription_AD.d64

Moscription was written in BASIC and compiled using MOSpeed: https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2
