MOSCRIPTION IS A DECK-BUILDING CARD GAMEFOR ONE PLAYER. THE GOAL IS TO DEALDIRECT DAMAGE TO YOUR OPPONENT; THECOMPUTER PLAYER. A PLAYER WINS ONCE HEOR SHE HAS DEALT 8 POINTS MORE DAMAGE TOTHE OPPONENT THAN THE OPPONENT HAS TOHIM/HER. THE DAMAGE BALANCE IS SHOWN BYA RED/GREEN BAR IN THE LOWER PART OF THESCREEN. EACH CARD HAS AN ATTACK VALUE RANGINGFROM 0 TO X. DIRECT DAMAGE IS DEALT ONLYIF THERE IS NO OPPOSING CARD ON THEBOARD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ATTACK ORIF THE DEFENSE VALUE OF THE OPPOSINGCARD IS LOWER THAN THE VALUE OF THEATTACK. OTHERWISE; THE DAMAGE IS DEALTTO THE ATTACKED CARD INSTEAD POTENTIALLYDAMAGING OR KILLING IT.   ***
